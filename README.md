Django Language Preference Middleware
=====================================

This repo contains basic middleware that retrieves a user's language 
preference and sets it on the request session.

Usage
=====
Subclass `LanguagePreferenceMiddleware` and override the
`get_user_language_preference` method.

Your new middleware should be
tested by including `LangPrefMiddlewareTestCaseMixin` in your test case and
overriding the `middleware_class`, `get_user`, and 
`set_user_language_preference` attributes.

Testing
=======

    $ make validate
